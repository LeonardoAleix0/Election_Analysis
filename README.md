# Election Analysis

 ## Project Overview

A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given you the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election:

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on the popular vote.


## Resources

Data Source: election_results.csv

Software: Python 3.7.6, Visual Studio Code 1.38.1

## Results

The analysis of the election show that:

There were 369,711 votes cast in the election.

The candidates were:

* Charles Casper Stockham
* Diana DeGette
* Raymond Anthony Doane

The candidate results were:

* Charles Casper Stockham received 23.0% of the vote and 85,213 number of votes.

* Diana DeGette received 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 number of votes.

* Raymond Anthony Doane received 3.1% of the vote and 11,606 number of votes.

The winner of the election was:

* Diana DeGette, who received 272,892 number of votes, 73.8% of the total votes cast in the election.

## Challenge Overview

In this challenge an employee from the Colorado Board of Elections has requested to have an audit completed of a recent local congressional election. The were five tasks required to support the audit described below:

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on the popular vote.

After delivering the first request, a second set of information was required to complete the audit.

1. Calculate the total number of votes each county received.
2. Calculate the percentage of votes each county received.
3. Determine the county with largest number of votes.

## Summary

Although this code has been created to complete an audit in a local election, the same structure can be used to analyze more information related to elections. Due to the content of the dataset, the analysis contained in this project is limited. However, adding more data to the dataset and using the same code, we could reveal important data related to the voters. For example, one important information would be the number of votes that each party has received. Acquiring this information may provide a hint in which direction that region is going to vote in the National elections.
Another example for which this code can be used, is to describe the number of voters based on demographics, understanding the relationship between demographics and candidate/party can reveal the regions or ages that the candidates should focus on their campaign.
